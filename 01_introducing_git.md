# What Exactly is Git?

## Version Control

Version control is software that <strong>tracks and manages changes</strong> to files over time.</br>
Version control systems generally allow users to revisit earlier versions of the files, compare changes between versions, undo changes, and a whole lot more.</br>

## Git is just one VCS

Git is just one of the many version control systems available today. Other well-known ones include Subversion, CVS and Mercurial. They all have similar goals, but vary significantly in how they achieve those goals. Fortunately, we only need to care about Git because it is the clear "winner".

## Git helps us...

<ul>
    <li>Track changes across multiple files</li>
    <li>Compare versions of a project</li>
    <li>"Time travel" back to old versions</li>
    <li>Revert to a previous version</li>
    <li>Collaborate and share changes</li>
    <li>Combine changes</li>
</ul>

## A Quick History of Git

Linus Torvalds is a legendary software engineer. He is the creator and main developer behind Linux and Git! In 2005, while working on Linux, he became frustrated with the available version control systems. The existing tools were slow, closed-source, and usually paid.<br />
Torvalds wanted a version control system that was super fast AND free, unlike the existing tools. On April 3rd 2005 he got to work on his own VCS, which would become Git. In a matter of days he had most basic functionality done. The first official Git release came a couple months later. 15 years later in 2020, over 90% developers worldwide use Git on a daily basis!<br />
Torvalds referred to Git as "the stupid content tracker" while he was working on it. Eventually he settled on the name Git. The official Git source code explains a couple different meanings for the name, depending on your mood:

<ul>
    <li>A random three-letter combination that is pronouceable, and not actually used by any common UNIX command.</li>
    <li>Stupid. Contemptible and despicable. Simple.</li>
    <li>"Global Information Tracker": You are in a good mood, and it actually works for you. Angels sing, and a light suddenly fills the room.</li>
    <li>"G#ddamn Idiotic Truckload" of sh*t: when it breaks.</li>
</ul>

## Who Uses Git?

<strong>Engineers & Coders.</strong> From massive tech giants like Facebook and Google to the tiniest of startups, developers across the globe use Git. If you plan on becoming a developer, Git is a must-have skill.<br />
<strong>Tech-Adjacent Roles.</strong> Many people in non-developer roles end up learning the basics of Git to collaborate with their coworkers. Designers in particular often need to work with Git.<br />
<strong>Governments.</strong> In recent years, governments have started using Git to manage the drafting of laws. Washington DC City council uses Git & GitHub to publish its laws. Citizens have even found and fixed typos collaboratively using Git!<br />
<strong>Scientists.</strong> Git is commonly used by research teams at universities and agencies around the world to manage code, data sets, and more. Git and GitHub is especially powerful in the peer-reviewed world of science and research.<br />
<strong>Writers.</strong> Some writers love using Git to manage drafts of complex novels, screenplays, or other works with lots of moving parts and constant changes across multiple files. In particular, Git is gaining popularity for use in collaborative textbook writing with multiple authors.<br />
<strong>Anyone Really.</strong> People find very creative uses for Git ranging from keeping a daily diary to drafting PhD theses to tracking changes to photoshop files. At least one composer writes his symphonies using Git!<br />

## Git !== GitHub

<strong>Git</strong> is a version control software that runs locally on your machine. You don't need to register for an account. You don't need the internet to use it. You can use Git without ever touching GitHub.
<strong>GitHub</strong> is a service that hosts Git repositories in the cloud and makes it easier to collaborate with other people. You do need to sign up for an account to use GitHub. It is an online place to share work that is done using Git.
