# GitHub Grab Bag: Odds & Ends

## GitHub Repo Visibility: Public vs. Private

<strong>Public Repos</strong><br />
Public repos are accessible to everyone on the internet. Anyone can see the repo on GitHub.<br />

<strong>Private Repos</strong><br />
Private repos are only accessible to the owner and people who have been granted access.<br />

## What are READMEs?

A README is used to communicate important information about a repository including:

<ul>
  <li>What the project does</li>
  <li>How to run the project</li>
  <li>Why it's noteworthy</li>
  <li>Who maintains the project</li>
</ul>

If you put a README in the root of your project, <strong>GitHub will recognize it and automatically display it on the repo's home page</strong>.<br />
READMEs are markdown files, ending with the `.md` extension. Markdown is a convenient syntax to generate formatted text. It's easy to pick up.<br />

## Creating GitHub Gists

**GitHub Gists** are a simple way to share code snippets and useful fragments with others. Gists are much easier to create, but offer far fewer features than a typical GitHub repository.<br />
