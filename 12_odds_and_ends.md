# GitHub Grab Bag: Odds & Ends

## GitHub Repo Visibility: Public vs. Private

<strong>Public Repos</strong><br />
Public repos are accessible to everyone on the internet. Anyone can see the repo on GitHub.<br />

<strong>Private Repos</strong><br />
Private repos are only accessible to the owner and people who have been granted access.<br />

## What are READMEs?

A README is used to communicate important information about a repository including:

<ul>
  <li>What the project does</li>
  <li>How to run the project</li>
  <li>Why it's noteworthy</li>
  <li>Who maintains the project</li>
</ul>

If you put a README in the root of your project, <strong>GitHub will recognize it and automatically display it on the repo's home page</strong>.<br />
READMEs are markdown files, ending with the `.md` extension. Markdown is a convenient syntax to generate formatted text. It's easy to pick up.<br />

## Creating GitHub Gists

**GitHub Gists** are a simple way to share code snippets and useful fragments with others. Gists are much easier to create, but offer far fewer features than a typical GitHub repository.<br />

## Introducing GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages are public webpages that are hosted and published via GitHub. They allow you to create a website simply by pushing your code to GitHub.<br />

**Static Sites**<br />
GitHub Pages is a hosting service for static webpages, so it does not support server-side code like Python, Ruby, or Node. Just HTML/CSS/JS!<br />

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)<br />

**User Site**<br />
You get one user site per GitHub account. This is where you could host a portfolio site or some form of personal website. The default url is based on your GitHub username, following this pattern: `username.github.io` though you can change this!<br />

**Project Sites**<br />
You get unlimited project sites! Each GitHub repo can have a corresponding hosted website. It's as simple as telling GitHub which specific branch contains the web content. The default urls follow this pattern: `username.github.io/repo-name`.<br />
